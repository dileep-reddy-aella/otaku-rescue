#Otaku-rescue:

#Aim: 
      Otaku is a manga fan. He searches the web everyday to check if new chapters of Boruto are released or not. But this is a tiresome process as he has to open the website every day and search for Borutoâ€™s newly released chapters. 
      What I want to do is write a web scraper code which scrapes the Manga reader website and notify otaku through email if new chapters are released.
